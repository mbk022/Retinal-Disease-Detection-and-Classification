# Retinal-Disease-Detection-and-Classification
Multiple Retinal disease detection and Classification using Deep Learning


The ipynb for the Disease Classification is added to the release as it is larger than 25 MB

This work aims to make use of transfer learning to train multiple deep learning
models to train on the RFMiD Dataset for the detection and classification of different
retinal diseases. The main purpose of this project is to provide a cost-efficient way to
detect the early onset of retinal diseases in place of traditional methodologies. The
detection of presence of a disease is performed and if a disease is detected, classification
models can be used to classify among the different models. As the Disease detection
accuracy is expected to be high, regardless of the result of classification, the patient can
then visit an ophthalmologist for further diagnosis and treatment for his/her diseases.
Existing pre-trained models are trained on the ImageNet dataset and are
supposed to work well on image detection or classification tasks. In this project,
different pre-trained deep learning models are trained and tested on the RFMiD dataset
for the detection of the presence of a Retinal Disease and also to classify among the
diseases. The deep learning models are tested and compared using different evaluation
criteria.

The dataset used in this project is the Retinal Fundus Multi-Disease Image Dataset
(RFMiD). The dataset consists of 3200 fundus images with 45 different retinal diseases.
The dataset is split into 3 subsets; training 60%, evaluation/ validation 20% and test set
20%.
